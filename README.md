# Types-of-Network

 ## 1. Based on Geographical Area
### a. Personal Area Network (PAN)
 Definition: A PAN is the smallest and most basic network type, used for connecting devices within the range of an individual.

Range: ~10 meters

Devices: Smartphones, laptops, tablets, wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches)

Technology Used: Bluetooth, Infrared, USB

Example: Connecting your Bluetooth headset to your phone.

### b. Local Area Network (LAN)
Definition: A LAN connects computers and devices in a limited area like a home, school, or office building.

Range: Within a building or campus

Speed: High (100 Mbps to 10 Gbps)

Technology Used: Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi

Example: A company's internal network where employees access shared printers and files.

### c. Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)
Definition: A MAN covers a city or a large campus area. It’s larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.

Range: Covers a city or town

Technology Used: Fiber optics, DSL, Cable

Example: A city-wide Wi-Fi network or an ISP’s infrastructure within a city.

### d. Wide Area Network (WAN)
Definition: A WAN spans a large geographical area, often a country or the globe.

Range: Global

Technology Used: Satellite links, leased lines, MPLS

Example: The Internet is the largest WAN.

### e. Campus Area Network (CAN)
Definition: A CAN connects multiple LANs within a limited geographical area like a university, business campus, or military base.

Example: A university network connecting different departments and libraries.

### f. Global Area Network (GAN)
Definition: Connects multiple WANs and covers an unlimited geographical area.

Example: A satellite communication network that connects multiple continents.

##  2. Based on Network Architecture
### a. Client-Server Network
Definition: A centralized network where a server provides resources and services to multiple clients.

Pros: Secure, easy to manage

Cons: Expensive setup, server dependency

Example: A company server providing email services to employees.

### b. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network
Definition: Each device acts as both a client and a server, sharing resources equally.

Pros: Cost-effective, no central server required

Cons: Less secure, harder to manage

Example: Torrent file sharing (e.g., BitTorrent).
